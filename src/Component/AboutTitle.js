          This drastic appeal for baked goods promoted baking all throughout
          Europe and expanded into the eastern parts of Asia. Bakers started
          baking breads and goods at home and selling them out on the streets.

          Baked goods have been around for thousands of years. The art of baking
          was developed early during the Roman Empire. It was a highly famous
          art as Roman citizens loved baked goods and demanded for them
          frequently for important occasions such as feasts and weddings etc.
          Due to the fame and desire that the art of baking received, around 300
          BC, baking was introduced as an occupation and respectable profession
          for Romans.{" "}
