                          This drastic appeal for baked goods promoted baking
                          all throughout Europe and expanded into the eastern
                          parts of Asia. Bakers started baking breads and goods
                          at home and selling them out on the streets.

                          Baked goods have been around for thousands of years.
                          The art of baking was developed early during the Roman
                          Empire. It was a highly famous art as Roman citizens
                          loved baked goods and demanded for them frequently for
                          important occasions such as feasts and weddings etc.
                          Due to the fame and desire that the art of baking
                          received, around 300 BC, baking was introduced as an
                          occupation and respectable profession for Romans.
